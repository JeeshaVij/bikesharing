# Overview of Project

This project is about creating a proposal for a bike-share business in Des Moines, similar to the one in New York city.  

The first step is to figure out how the bike-share business actually work in New York. From there a proposal as to how it might work 
in Des Moines can be created for the investers. The proposal will be based on the visualizations being prepared through Tableau and the
data used is the Citi Bike data that has been released to public.

## Summary

In this project, a proposal is to be prepared to start a bike-share business in Des Moines. The data used is of the Citi Bike business in 
the New York city. Various graphs and a dashborad/story has been created to display as to how the business works.

Two additional visualizations suggested for future analysis can be:
- Number of trips taken in other months
- Find the number of rides by the age group
